# Theory: Vigilance Decrement and Cognitive Fatigue

**Vigilance decrement** describes the decline in attention and performance over time during sustained tasks.  
Originally studied using the **Mackworth Clock Test**, it shows that detection accuracy drops significantly after 20–30 minutes.

### Mechanisms
- **Resource depletion:** Mental effort consumes limited attentional resources.
- **Arousal reduction:** Prolonged focus lowers physiological alertness.
- **Monotony effects:** Repetitive tasks reduce motivation and engagement.

### Cognitive Models
- **Yerkes–Dodson Law (1908):** There is an optimal level of arousal for performance; too little or too much reduces efficiency.
- **Resource Theory (Kahneman, 1973):** Attention operates as a limited capacity system.
