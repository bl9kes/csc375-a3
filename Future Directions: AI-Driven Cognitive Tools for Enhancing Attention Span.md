# Future Directions: AI-Driven Cognitive Tools for Enhancing Attention Span

## Introduction
The future of improving **attention span** is bright. With the advancement of artificial intelligence, improvement techniques are expected to shift away from purely motivational and behavioural tactics, as AI-driven systems grow in both popularity and effectiveness. Researchers have already begun to experiment with systems that can understand and adapt to individual cognitive limits.

Recent developments in AI have revealed two complementary methods to improve attention span.

#### Software-based AI Systems
Yusri et al. (2023) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia developed an adaptive learning system that utilizes AI to enhance attention.

#### Hardware-based AI Systems
Cohen Kadosh et al. (2025) explored neuroadaptive hardware capable of directly modulating brain activity to improve sustained focus.

These innovations mark the beginning of a promising future in optimizing the limited and valuable resource of human attention. Together, they highlight the potential of AI—both in digital and neuroadaptive forms to enhance sustained focus.

## Speed Reading Tool Powered by Artificial Intelligence 
Developed by Yusri et al. (2023) at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, this AI-powered speed reading tool is designed to support students with ADHD, dyslexia, or short attention spans. The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a web-based interface to summarize long texts while emphasizing key phrases through half-word bolding and customizable spacing, helping improve reading speed and information comprehension.

### Key Features
#### AI Text Summarization
Utilizes the T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) to convert lengthy texts into concise summaries that capture key ideas.

#### Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
Supports deeper concept understanding and decision-making, handling complex summarization and keyword selection efficiently.

#### Half-word Bolding
Automatically bolds the first half of selected keywords to guide the reader's attention. This helps the reader identify important phrases quickly while improving retention.

#### Customizable Text Formatting
Allows a personalized reading experience with adjustable line, word, and character spacing to their personal liking. Also supports custom font size and weight.


### Results and Significance
The system displayed improved reading speed and comprehension in test users, especially among those with ADHD and attention-related challenges. Users also reported enhanced readability due to the customizable display options. By combining natural language processing and user interface design, the project effectively demonstrated cognitive augmentation for improved attention. The findings are significant as they suggest that a scalable, software-based approach to promoting focus in digital environments is achievable.

## AI-Guided Neurostimulation: Beyond Behavioural Training
Complementing this software innovation, Cohen Kadosh et al. (2025) introduced a home-based AI-personalized neurostimulation system, leveraging transcranial random noise stimulation to improve sustained attention, without discomfort or the need for supervision. The personalization aspect is driven by a Bayesian optimization algorithm that adapts the stimulation based on the user's baseline attention.
As a result, participants demonstrated significant improvements on sustained attention tasks, highlighting the promising future of AI-assisted neurotechnology.

### Key Features
#### Personalized Bayesian Optimization
The system determines each participant's optimal tRNS intensity using a Bayesian optimization algorithm. The algorithm is individualized, adapting stimulation parameters based on baseline attention and head circumference.

#### Home-Based Neurostimulation Setup
Participants use CE-marked tRNS headgear and a tablet interface, allowing them to easily participate at home. Stimulus parameters for each session are automatically uploaded to a cloud-based system for analysis and next-session optimization. The automatic and unsupervised nature of the setup makes attention enhancement more accessible and scalable.

#### Closed-Loop Feedback System
Automatic uploads of session results enable the system to analyze user performance and automatically make adjustments to future stimulus parameters. This continuous feedback loop supports progressive improvement and represents a key step toward self-optimizing, attention-aware systems that align with Kahneman's capacity-based theory.

### Results and Significance
The system significantly improved sustained attention, particularly among participants who showed lower baseline focus levels. Additionally, no negative effects were reported, indicating the system's safety and practicality for unsupervised use. The combination of AI-driven personalization and adaptive neurostimulation effectively enhanced cognitive performance through tailored, data-driven feedback. All in all, the results suggest the system is not only effective in improving sustained attention but, more importantly, safe, scalable, and user-friendly, a major step forward with attention-enhancement technologies

## Ethical and Societal Considerations
As AI becomes embedded in cognitive enhancement, several challenges must be addressed:
#### Data Privacy
With the private nature of the cognitive, behavioural, and neural data being collected, we must ensure that such information remains protected, and privacy is of high priority. 

#### Equal Access
AI-driven tools will likely be an important part of the future and will grow in popularity and usage. That being said, it is equally important to keep them affordable and accessible to all. Equal access to the systems is critical to prevent deepening educational inequality.

#### Dependence
Overreliance on AI-driven systems risks externalization of cognitive regulation and weakening natural attention systems. It is important to use this tool in complement to traditional focus strategies like Timeblocking and the Pomodoro technique.

## Conclusion
Together, these studies highlight complementary methods toward enhancing attention span through technology. The success of the software-based system by Yusri et al. (2023) demonstrates how AI and interface design for adaptive text presentation can improve reading speed and comprehension among students. Whereas Cohen et al. (2025) and their hardware-based approach can directly modulate cognitive capacity and sustained attention, using personalized stimulation. 

Both approaches to cognitive augmentation emphasize the importance of personalized, adaptive systems in extending attention. This indicates that information delivery and intake is not a one-size-fits-all all and the ability to personalize it supports focus and optimized learning. 

Future directions in this field point toward hybrid systems that combine neurophysiological insight with contextual awareness—helping individuals stay engaged, informed, and mentally balanced.
