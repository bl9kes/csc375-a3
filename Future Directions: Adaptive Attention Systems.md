# Future Directions: Adaptive Attention Systems

Emerging technologies are beginning to measure and adapt to users' attention states in real time.

### Current Research Areas
- **EEG-based monitoring** to detect lapses in focus.
- **AI-driven productivity systems** that recommend breaks or shift task types based on fatigue indicators.
- **Biofeedback training** for improving sustained attention.

### Implications
Future focus tools may dynamically adjust difficulty, environment, or timing based on measured attention levels — creating personalized, *attention-aware systems*.
