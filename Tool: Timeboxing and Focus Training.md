# Tool: Timeboxing and Focus Training

To counter attention decay, structured techniques help manage focus duration and recovery.

### Common Techniques
1. **Pomodoro Technique** — 25-minute focused work sessions followed by 5-minute breaks.  
   Promotes rhythmic attention cycles and prevents burnout.
2. **Timeboxing** — Allocating fixed time blocks to tasks increases accountability.
3. **Task Chunking** — Breaking large projects into smaller goals reduces cognitive overload.
4. **Digital Focus Tools** — Apps like Forest or RescueTime provide feedback on attention span and screen habits.

### Cognitive Basis
Structured breaks allow attentional networks to recover and re-engage, aligning with the **vigilance recovery hypothesis**.
