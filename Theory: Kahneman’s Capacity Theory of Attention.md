# Theory: Kahneman’s Capacity Theory of Attention

## Introduction
Daniel Kahneman introduced the **Capacity Theory of Attention (1973)** in his book **Attention and Effort**. The theory described attention as a limited mental resource. The theory provides one of the most influential explanations for why human attention span is limited.  
Kahneman did not view attention as a single channel or filter; rather, he proposed that attention functions as a limited pool of mental resources that can be divided across different tasks, but doing so reduces its availability and impacts performance.
When task demands exceed this available capacity, performance declines, and focus begins to drift - forming the psychological basis for **attention span**.

## Core Concepts of the Model

### Limited Capacity
The human mind has a finite pool of mental energy.
Any activity that requires brain power draws energy from this pool, depleting it.
If the ammount of energy demanded exceed the amount available, attention becomes scattered and decreases performance, leading to errors, fatigue and task abandonment.

### Dual Imputs per Activity
Each acticity requires two inputs: 
  1. Specific information input: The cognitive data associated to the task.
  2. Non-Specific Capacity input: The attention required to initiate and sustain the task.


## Key Machanism of the Model
Kahneman’s model is a control diagram (Figure 1.2) that describes the relations of influence and control between components of a system.

### 1. Avalable Capacity and Arousal
Arousal determines the available capacity at a given time.
Arousal and Effort fluctuate together:
  - Moderate arousal increases usable capacity.
  - High and Low arousal reduces usable capacity.

### 2. Allocation Policy
Kahneman's model proposed that attention is allocated according to an internal policy influenced by:
- **Enduring dispositions** — automatic attention to novel or significant stimuli. 
- **Momentary intentions** — conscious goals.  
- **Evaluation of demands** — if total demand exceeds capacity, one task is prioritized or completed first.  
- **Arousal effects** — higher arousal shifts how attention is distributed across tasks.

This flexibility allows people to adapt attention dynamically, but it also leads to increased vulnerabitly to interruptions.

### 3. Possible Activities
In Kahneman’s model, possible activities refer to all mental tasks that are candidates for receiving attention
Different mental activities impose different demands on the limited capacity.
  - Low-demand activities require minimal capacity and oftem times run automatically.
  - High-demand activities require a larger share of the limited capacity pool.
Only those that receive both information input and capacity input are fully executed. 
When the total demand accross active tasks exceed the capacity performance decreases, leading to inefficienies, reduced accuracy, and sometimes failures.

## What does this mean for Attention Span?
Kahneman's model, attention-span is not fixed, it is constantly changging and reflect the balance between avaialable capacity and demand from the task at hand. If demand exceed capacity, problems occurs and attention begins to fade.

There are many factors that impact the balance:
- The primary factor is the complexity of the task. Those with higher cognitive load demand more attention and deplete resouces more rapidly.
- The individual's level of motivation is also to a factor. This is ciritical as a motivation to completed meaningful or rewarding task increases capacity and resource allocation.
- Fatigue and Stress also have an impact; increased stress and fatigue levels reduce total capacity, decreasing abilities.

These insight gained from Kahneman's model forms the foundation for designing systems that upport sustained attention by governing mental effort and preventing mental overload.

## Design Implications for Cognitive Augmentation
Kahneman's theory and models provides a foundation for designing tools that align with how human attention actually operates, as a limited, allocable mental resource. Rather than trying to overcome biological limits, cognitive augmentation systems should help users manage and optimize their finite capacity.

### Cognitive Augmentatioon Tools and Systems
- **Timeboxing and Pomodoro tools** help users manage effort by segmenting work by cognitive load and determining recovery cycles.  
- **Gamified environments** can temporarily boost motivation and arousal, expanding the effective capacity available for sustained attention.

In this way, technology can support and increase attention span by guiding the allocation of mental effort rather than overwhelming it, through rhythm, feedback, and intentional recovery periods.
