# Theory: Kahneman’s Capacity Theory of Attention

## Introduction
Daniel Kahneman introduced the **Capacity Theory of Attention (1973)** in his book **Attention and Effort**. The theory described attention as a limited mental resource. The theory provides one of the most influential explanations for why human attention span is limited.  
Kahneman did not view attention as a single channel or filter; rather, he proposed that attention functions as a limited pool of mental resources that can be divided across different tasks, but doing so reduces its availability and impacts performance.
When task demands exceed this available capacity, performance declines, and focus begins to drift - forming the psychological basis for **attention span**.

## Core Concepts of the Model

### Limited Capacity
The human mind has a finite pool of mental energy.
Any activity that requires brain power draws energy from this pool, depleting it.
If the ammount of energy demanded exceed the amount available, attention becomes scattered and decreases performance, leading to errors, fatigue and task abandonment.

### Dual Imputs per Activity
Each acticity requires two inputs: 
  1. Specific information input: The cognitive data associated to the task.
  2. Non-Specific Capacity input: The attention required to initiate and sustain the task.


## Key Machanism of the Model
Kahneman’s model is a control diagram (Figure 1.2) that describes the relations of influence and control between components of a system.

### 1. Avalable Capacity and Arousal
Arousal determines the available capacity at a given time.
Arousal and Effort fluctuate together:
  - Moderate arousal increases usable capacity.
  - High and Low arousal reduces usable capacity.

### 2. Allocation Policy
Kahneman's model proposed that attention is allocated according to an internal policy influenced by:
- **Enduring dispositions** — automatic attention to novel or significant stimuli. 
- **Momentary intentions** — conscious goals.  
- **Evaluation of demands** — if total demand exceeds capacity, one task is prioritized or completed first.  
- **Arousal effects** — higher arousal shifts how attention is distributed across tasks.

This flexibility allows people to adapt attention dynamically, but it also leads to increased vulnerabitly to interruptions.

### 3. Possible Activities
In Kahneman’s model, possible activities refer to all mental tasks that are candidates for receiving attention
Different mental activities impose different demands on the limited capacity.
  - Low-demand activities require minimal capacity and oftem times run automatically.
  - High-demand activities require a larger share of the limited capacity pool.
Only those that receive both information input and capacity input are fully executed. 
When the total demand accross active tasks exceed the capacity performance decreases, leading to inefficienies, reduced accuracy, and sometimes failures.

## Implications for Attention Span
Under Kahneman’s model, attention span is not fixed — it reflects the ongoing balance between **available capacity** and **task demand**.  
When the demand surpasses capacity, attention falters.  
Factors that influence this balance include:
- **Task complexity** — higher cognitive load drains attention faster.  
- **Motivation** — meaningful or rewarding goals increase resource allocation.  
- **Fatigue and stress** — reduce the total available capacity.

These insights form the foundation for designing systems that **support sustained attention** by pacing mental effort and preventing overload.

## Design Implications for Cognitive Augmentation
Understanding attention as a capacity-based system has practical value for cognitive augmentation design:
- **Timeboxing and Pomodoro tools** help users manage effort by segmenting work and recovery cycles.  
- **Adaptive focus systems** could monitor indicators of mental load and prompt timely breaks or refocusing cues.  
- **Gamified environments** can temporarily boost motivation, expanding the effective capacity available for attention.

In this way, technology can be designed not to override human limits, but to **help users manage their finite attention resources** more effectively.

**Summary:**  
Kahneman’s Capacity Theory of Attention explains that focus is sustained only while mental resources remain sufficient for task demands.  
When those resources are depleted — through fatigue, overload, or distraction — attention wanes.  
By applying this model, designers and researchers can create systems that respect human limits while supporting longer, more sustainable periods of concentration.
